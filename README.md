# SportTeams Migration Project

## Current Status
This project contains the migration plan and setup for rebuilding the SportTeams application with:

- **From**: Supabase + Lovable platform
- **To**: Progress DB + PHP Laravel + React

## Quick Start

1. **Review Implementation Plan**
   ```bash
   cat IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
   ```

2. **Setup Project Structure**
   ```bash
   chmod +x structure_setup.sh
   ./structure_setup.sh
   ```

3. **Next Steps**
   - Configure Progress DB connection
   - Setup Laravel backend
   - Implement security layer
   - Build React frontend

## Key Improvements

### Security Fixes
- ❌ **Current**: Any authenticated user sees all players/profiles
- ✅ **New**: Team-scoped access with encrypted JWT

### Performance Improvements
- Connection pooling for Progress DB
- Redis caching with TTL strategies
- Optimized queries with indexed views

### Architecture Benefits
- Decoupled frontend/backend
- Proper multi-language support
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Rate limiting and security middleware

## Files in This Directory

- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed step-by-step implementation plan
- `structure_setup.sh` - Script to create project structure  
- `README.md` - This file
- `migration/` - Original prototype files and analysis

## Development Approach

1. **Build structure first** (current step)
2. **No mockup data** - Connect to real Progress DB
3. **Component by component** - Each piece fully functional
4. **Incremental testing** - Verify each step works

Ready to proceed with the actual implementation!
