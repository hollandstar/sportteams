# SportTeams Project - Test Results and Communication Protocol

## Original User Problem Statement
The user initially built a prototype "SportTeams" application with PostgreSQL on Supabase. The goal is to refactor this prototype for improved architecture, maintainability, enhanced security, and multi-language support. Key requirements include migrating from Supabase, addressing security vulnerabilities, implementing team-scoped access control, and building UI components based on the original site design.

## Current Development Status
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Foundation setup with Laravel backend and React frontend
- **Phase 2 Complete**: Enhanced security with encrypted JWT, token rotation, team-scoped access
- **Phase 3 In Progress**: Frontend component development starting with navigation and routing

## Testing Protocol
### Backend Testing Guidelines
- Always test backend API endpoints with proper authentication headers
- Verify JWT token validation and refresh mechanisms
- Test team-scoped access control for all protected routes
- Ensure CORS configuration allows frontend communication
- Test database connections and query performance

### Frontend Testing Guidelines  
- Test navigation and routing functionality
- Verify Redux state management and API integration
- Test authentication flow and token handling
- Ensure responsive design across different screen sizes
- Test form validation and user interactions

### Communication Protocol with Testing Agents
- Provide clear, specific test scenarios
- Include expected outcomes and error handling
- Request detailed logs for failed tests
- Focus on critical user journeys first
- Report integration issues between frontend and backend

## Incorporate User Feedback
(This section will be updated as user feedback is received during development)
