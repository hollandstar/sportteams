The previous AI engineer successfully migrated the SportTeams application from Supabase to a new PostgreSQL instance, implementing a Laravel backend and a React/Vite frontend. Core development phases focused on establishing the project foundation, then significantly enhancing security with encrypted JWTs, token rotation, and role-based access control. A multi-language system was also set up. A major challenge involved extensive debugging of environment setups, supervisor configurations, and persistent frontend display issues primarily due to Tailwind CSS version conflicts and external preview routing problems. The preview issue was critically resolved by adding the preview domain to Vite's . Database schema and API endpoints for a new Team Admin role were completed and tested. The current focus has pivoted from building dashboard displays to analyzing the fundamental forms workflow for data input, as the user emphasized that no data can be generated or displayed without these input forms. The engineer is now analyzing external assets to understand these form designs.

The user initiated a refactoring of the SportTeams prototype, migrating its PostgreSQL database from Supabase to a new PostgreSQL instance on shared hosting. The core requirements involve a complete architectural overhaul for improved maintainability and robust security. Specifically, this includes addressing insecure Row Level Security (RLS) policies, implementing granular team-scoped access control, encrypted JWT-based authentication with token rotation, API rate limiting, and comprehensive audit logging. The application must support multi-language capabilities from the start, avoiding hardcoded text. Performance optimization through connection pooling, query optimization, and caching (e.g., Redis) is also required. The development approach emphasizes building component-by-component, integrating directly with the new database without mockup data. For the UI, frontend components, starting with navigation, are to be built based on provided live site designs. A critical new requirement is the implementation of a Team Admin role with specific security specifications. Most recently, the user stressed the absolute necessity of data input forms (condition tests, skill evaluations) as the foundation for all stats and dashboards, explicitly halting dashboard display development until the forms' workflow is analyzed.

    -   : New controller to handle API requests for the Team Admin role.
    -   , , : New Eloquent models defining the database structure for the Team Admin functionality and associated entities.
    -   : New service containing the business logic for Team Admin operations.
    -   : Contains new migration files (, , , ) that were created and modified to correctly use integer IDs and disable RLS.
    -   : Configured to include new API routes for the Team Admin controller, ensuring  prefix and proper middleware application.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully established the foundational SportTeams application, covering the migration from Supabase to a new PostgreSQL instance, and setting up a Laravel backend with a React/Vite frontend. Phase 1 involved setting up the core project structure, database migration, and basic Laravel and React application setup, culminating in a functional end-to-end login with a test admin user. Phase 2 focused on security, integrating encrypted JWTs (JWE), token rotation, and anti-replay mechanisms through custom Laravel services (, , ), and a PostgreSQL unique constraint issue was resolved. The frontend integrated Redux Toolkit for state management, refactoring the authentication flow.

Currently, the work is progressing into Phase 3. The initial efforts were directed at Phase 3A, building the Base Dashboard Framework for the frontend. This involved setting up React Router for role-based navigation, implementing a comprehensive multi-language translation system (Dutch and English), and creating foundational dashboard layout components (, , ) and initial role-specific dashboard pages (, , , ).

A significant portion of recent effort was dedicated to troubleshooting environment and preview issues. This included:
1.  Correcting supervisor configurations for both frontend and backend to point to the correct  paths using symbolic links.
2.  Installing missing PHP dependencies for the Laravel backend.
3.  Diagnosing and fixing persistent frontend display errors caused by an incorrect version and configuration of Tailwind CSS, which was resolved by downgrading Tailwind to v3.x and correctly configuring its PostCSS integration.
4.  Crucially, resolving a black screen preview issue. The problem stemmed from the platform's preview proxy expecting a specific service structure ( and ) and port (). This was fixed by creating a FastAPI proxy server at  that runs on port 8001 and forwards requests to the Laravel backend (now running on port 8002). The final piece of this puzzle was identified by the user: Vite's  needed to include the external preview domain (). Adding this to  successfully enabled the live preview.

Following the preview fix, the backend development for the Team Admin role (part of Phase 3B) was successfully completed, including new database migrations (handling integer IDs and disabling RLS), new Eloquent models, controllers, and services, all thoroughly tested.

The immediate current work, however, has pivoted. The user pointed out that despite the dashboard framework being in place, essential data input forms (e.g., for condition tests, skill evaluation, action type testing) are missing. The user explicitly stated, Forms are the input of all stats. Not a managed data set. NO forms , No stats. No dashboards, and requested an analysis of the forms' workflow using available assets. The engineer is now in the process of analyzing a newly provided external shared directory () to understand these form designs and their workflow.
