The previous AI engineer was tasked with refactoring a SportTeams prototype to address security vulnerabilities, migrate from Supabase, and enhance architecture for multi-language and performance. Initially, the user requested detailed technical advice, which the AI engineer provided extensively, identifying critical RLS flaws and proposing a new PostgreSQL/PHP/React stack. The trajectory shows an iterative, component-by-component build process. Phase 1 focused on setting up the core project structure, migrating the database from Supabase to PostgreSQL, and establishing a working Laravel backend and React frontend. Phase 2 extensively overhauled the security, implementing encrypted JWT, token rotation, and team-scoped access. The engineer diligently troubleshot environment setups and code issues. The work then transitioned to building the frontend UI components, starting with navigation, based on a live site analysis since the provided UI zip was inaccessible.

The user initially built a prototype SportTeams application (live at ) with a PostgreSQL database on Supabase. The primary goal is to refactor this prototype for improved architecture, maintainability across different languages, and enhanced security.
Explicit requests and intents include:
1.  **Architecture Change**: Migrate from Supabase (PostgreSQL) to a Progress DB (later clarified to be PostgreSQL on shared hosting).
2.  **Security Enhancement**: Address current security vulnerabilities, specifically insecure Row Level Security (RLS) policies (). Implement granular, team-scoped access control, JWT-based authentication (encrypted JWT with rotation), API rate limiting, and comprehensive audit logging.
3.  **Multi-language Support**: Implement a robust solution for multi-language capabilities.
4.  **Performance Optimization**: Improve application performance through connection pooling, query optimization, and caching strategies (e.g., Redis).
5.  **Build Approach**: Restructure the application by building component-by-component, avoiding mockup data and connecting directly to the new database.
6.  **UI Implementation**: Build frontend components, starting with navigation, based on provided UI screens (initially a zip, then a live URL).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **PostgreSQL**: The chosen relational database, replacing Supabase's PostgreSQL.
-   **PHP/Laravel**: Backend framework for the API layer.
-   **React/TypeScript**: Frontend framework using Vite for build.
-   **Redux Toolkit**: For client-side state management in the frontend.
-   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure authentication, specifically with JWE (JSON Web Encryption) and token rotation.
-   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: For enabling frontend-backend communication.
-   **Redis**: Proposed for caching and session management (though not fully implemented in current work).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a three-tier architecture: React frontend, Laravel backend API, and PostgreSQL database. The core project lives within a new  directory.



-   : A shell script created to initialize the project directory structure for both backend and frontend.
-   : Defines the PostgreSQL database schema, including tables like  and  for enhanced security. This replaced the initial  schema.
-   : Contains PostgreSQL functions (stored procedures) that enforce data access security at the database level.

-   : Configures CORS policies for the Laravel backend to allow requests from the frontend, enabling cross-origin communication.
-   : Stores environment variables for the React frontend, including  for API calls.
-   : An Axios-based API client for making backend calls, integrated with Redux for automatic token management and error handling.
-   : The main React component. It was updated to display API connection status, login form, and later integrated with Redux for authentication and uses the new navigation components.
-   : The entry point for the React application, wrapped with  to make the Redux store available to all components.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implementing the full multi-language solution on the backend.
-   Implementing advanced performance optimizations (e.g., full Redis caching).
-   Developing secure player management (CRUD operations) with team-scoped access.
-   Implementing advanced search and filtering functionality for players and teams.
-   Completely building out all frontend UI components based on the provided designs.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully completed Phase 1 (Foundation Setup) and Phase 2 (Enhanced Security & Authentication).

**Phase 1** involved:
-   Setting up the project structure within .
-   Migrating the database from Supabase to a new PostgreSQL instance on , including schema () and secure functions ().
-   Setting up the Laravel 11 backend, configuring its  for PostgreSQL, implementing a basic  and  endpoint, and ensuring proper routing and CORS.
-   Setting up the React frontend using Vite and TypeScript, configuring its , implementing a basic API service (), and a test  to verify backend connectivity.
-   Both backend and frontend are running, and an end-to-end login with a test admin user (/) is functional.

**Phase 2** focused on security:
-   **Backend**: Implemented , , and  for encrypted JWT (JWE), token rotation, team-scoped access, and anti-replay protection. The  was updated to use these services, and the middleware was registered. A PostgreSQL unique constraint issue was resolved.
-   **Frontend**: Integrated Redux Toolkit for state management (, , ), updated the  to handle token management, and refactored  and  to use Redux. Typed Redux hooks were also introduced.
-   The SportTeams - Phase 2: Enhanced Security interface is working, displaying the new security features, and the enhanced login flow is fully functional from the frontend.

**Current Work - Phase 3 (Frontend Component Build)**:
The engineer is currently building the frontend components, starting with navigation. It has just created the following files:
-   
-
